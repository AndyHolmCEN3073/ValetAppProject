# Problem Statement 
Employees at Five Star Valet have wanted a way to better understand their earning. Instead of having one arbitrary number to look at they want to see a breakdown of the specific earnings by location and day. Management would also like a way to gauge the performance of these locations in an effort to better place the employees. The added functionality of the individual employee knowing how much money they are losing to driving related expenses (mainly gas) is something that is also desired.
